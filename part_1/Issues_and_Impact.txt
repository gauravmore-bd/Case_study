. Issues Identified

- No check for duplicate SKU (which must be unique)
- Missing required field checks (name, sku, price, etc.)
- Not validating input types (like price as decimal, quantity as integer)
- Commits twice to DB; could be combined
- No error handling (e.g., try-catch)
- Logic assumes products are only stored in one warehouse
- Doesn't support optional fields gracefully


. Impact in Production

- Duplicate SKUs may break product search or create confusion
- API might crash on bad or missing input
- Data inconsistency if product insert works but inventory fails
- No meaningful error messages to the frontend/client
- Fails silently for edge business scenarios like multiple warehouse support

Note:
- Used db.session.flush() to get the product ID before committing to the database.
- Committing once after both product and inventory creation ensures consistent data if something fails.
- Casting price to float helps handle cases where input comes as a string.
