What the API does:
•	It shows a list of products that are low in stock for a given company.
•	Only shows products that had recent sales (in last 30 days).
•	Also shows supplier info so company can reorder.

My Assumptions 
•	There's a table called product_thresholds that stores the threshold for each product.
•	A product can have one or more suppliers, but we’re picking one for now.
•	We assume a sales table tracks product sales with a date.
•	Days until stockout is hardcoded as 7 for now, because I didn’t calculate actual rate.

Why I Did It Like This:
•	I broke down the problem step-by-step to make it easier to write and debug.
•	Used simple queries instead of complex joins to avoid confusion.
•	It’s slower because of the for loop and multiple DB calls, but it’s easier to understand.
•	This would be fine for a beginner project or small business, and can be optimized later.

Notes:
- Currently returning one supplier per product. Later, we can support preferred suppliers.
- Used loop and multiple simple queries to keep the logic clear and beginner-friendly.
- This can be optimized later using joins and bulk queries.
- I focused more on correctness and readability rather than speed, which suits my experience level
