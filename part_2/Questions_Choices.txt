Questions for Product Team:
•	Can a product belong to multiple suppliers?
•	Can a product be bundled multiple levels deep (nested bundles)?
•	Do warehouses belong to one company only?
•	Should inventory changes be tracked with reasons (like sale, return, restock)?
•	Do suppliers provide to multiple companies?


My Design Choices:
•	Used foreign keys to keep relations strong.
•	Added UNIQUE on SKU to stop duplicates.
•	Created inventory_changes table to track stock movements.
•	Used many-to-many for suppliers and product bundles.
•	Assumed warehouse belongs to only one company.
